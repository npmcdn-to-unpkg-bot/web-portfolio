<p>In 1986, the two story brick building and its adjoing 60-foot-high, square tower were converted into a bed-and-breakfast. The 14-room inn has seven guest rooms with private baths, a common living room, and library, as well as a sauna.</p>
<p>
High atop a cliff jutting into the clear, deep waters of Lake Superior, the Big Bay Point Lighthouse beckons adults in search of a secluded retreat from modern life. This unique bed-and-breakfast inn is one of the few surviving resident lighthouses in the country and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</p>

<p>
Sit before the fire in the living room, and recount the lighthouses you have seen and plan to see. Hike, bike, Ski, or snowshoe along the shore, or on the many trails in the area. Experience the deep solitude and unspoiled beauty of nature at the lighthouse inn.

<h1>About</h1>
<article>High atop a cliff jutting into the clear, deep waters of Lake Superior, the Big Bay Point Lighthouse beckons adults in search of a secluded retreat from modern life. This unique bed-and-breakfast inn is one of the few surviving resident lighthouses in the country and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
For over a century, mariners have relied on Big Bay Point's light to guide them along this remote and rocky stretch of Michigan coastline. Although automated in 1941, the romance and lore of the site are undimmed.
Sit before the fire in the living room, and recount the lighthouses you have seen and plan to see. Hike, bike, Ski, or snowshoe along the shore, or on the many trails in the area. Experience the deep solitude and unspoiled beauty of nature at the lighthouse inn.
GPS coordinates are W 87.40.480 North 46.50.280 If your GPS takes you onto a two trqck road through the woods, turn back to the paved road.</article>
